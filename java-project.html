                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The aim of the project was to develop a project management system that allows users to create, edit, and manage tasks within a project. The system aimed to provide a comprehensive tool for task management, incorporating features like task assignment, adjacency matrix representation, and domain graph visualisation.</p>

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Deliverables</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Domain Knowledge and Graph:</b> The project included the creation of domain and entity classes in Kotlin to represent tasks as graphs, supporting the Java-based GUI application. This structure allowed users to visualise project dependencies and tasks in a structured manner.</li>
                    <li><b>Adjacency Matrix Implementation:</b> An adjacency matrix was created in Kotlin, enabling users to view the task dependencies within a project. This matrix was integrated into the GUI, offering a clear and readable representation of the project's structure.
                    <li><b>Desktop Application with GUI:</b>  The team successfully developed a desktop application using Java, which provided users with the ability to create, edit, and delete projects and their tasks through a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>

                <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Java:</b> Used for developing the desktop application with a GUI, which allowed users to interact with the system through buttons for creating, updating, and deleting tasks and projects.</li>
                    <li><b>Kotlin:</b> Employed to create the domain classes and graphs representing the project tasks. Kotlin was also used to implement the adjacency matrix, which visualises the connections between tasks.</li>
